None of these changes are guaranteed to be incorporated into any
version of Boa.  They are, at least, interesting ideas that deserve
not to be forgotten.

=================
Internal changes:

Convert to autoconf.

More modular connection to the document output code, allow data
to come from other than an mmap()'d file; this is a prerequisite
for the items labeled [*] below.

Request parsing speedup (maybe): on read_header and read_body, count
the bytes read into the body.  stop at content_length.  if this is not
supplied, after each read check buf[bytes-2] and buf[bytes-1] for
\r and \n -- if true, it's done, read no more.

Reduce malloc/free thrashing

Move server_root processing out of boa.c main(), use GNU getcwd(3)
memory allocation feature if it exists.

collapse write of very small files with header write?

Profile!

alias.c: add_alias(), collapse most of if/else common code;
alias.c: add_alias(), use FOUR_LETTER_SUM macro
alias.c: translate_uri(), collapse alias code with standard

Flexible support for CGI "gateway" programs, like Apache suEXEC
or an XSSI interpreter.

=================
Features for Users:

Access control (optional, it _will_ slow things down if used)

[*] Server-side includes 

[*] Something faster than server-side includes, but with similar
functionality;  I imagine a bytestream execution engine that is
specifically _not_ Turing complete, so that it is guaranteed to finish :-)

[*] On-the-fly server status page

[*] embedded imagemap handling

Write (or find) a wrapper which looks up the "missing" CGI
environment variables before exec'ing the real CGI program

=================
Features for Webmaster:

Limit service to particular devices (via statbuf->st_dev), keeps
Boa from stalling if a user links from his home to a lousy NFS server.

chroot(2) support

Virtualhost support

Logging with syslog (Unix)

Log files can be automatically cycled or archived

Normal (hit) log entries can be customized

Can write to multiple logs (such as for certain kinds of hits, or different
logs with different record formats)

Make smarter logfile resolver program, also can split output if used
in a virtualhost context.  Should keep a timestamped log of name lookup
results, which can also be read back as a cache.

Fascist logging option

Lighter weight logging?

=================
Obscure comment, what does it mean?  Is it important?
